## 🚀 **Usage in Your Main Project**

### **Installation**
```bash
npm install @lumenbro/chainsig-stellar
```

### **Basic Usage**
```javascript
// CommonJS (recommended)
const { chainAdapters, contracts } = require('@lumenbro/chainsig-stellar');

// Use Stellar alongside other chains
const stellar = new chainAdapters.stellar.Stellar({
  networkId: 'mainnet',
  contract: yourChainSignatureContract
});

// Derive Stellar address from NEAR account
const { address, publicKey } = await stellar.deriveAddressAndPublicKey(
  'your-near-account.near',
  'stellar-1'
);

// Check balance
const { balance, decimals } = await stellar.getBalance(address);

// Prepare and sign transactions
const preparedTx = await stellar.prepareTransactionForSigning({
  from: address,
  to: recipientAddress,
  amount: '10000000', // 1 XLM in stroops
  publicKey: publicKey
});
```

## 🎯 **What You Can Do Now**

1. **Use in your main project**: Install and integrate Stellar support
2. **Test with real NEAR accounts**: Derive Stellar addresses from your existing NEAR accounts
3. **Perform Stellar transactions**: Use MPC signing through your Chain Signatures contract
4. **Check balances**: Query Stellar account balances via Horizon API

## 🔧 **Integration with Your Existing Setup**

The package integrates seamlessly with your existing NEAR Chain Signatures setup:

- Uses the same MPC contract (`v1.signer`)
- Derives Stellar addresses from NEAR accounts
- Supports both mainnet and testnet
- Full TypeScript support
- Comprehensive error handling

## 🎉 **Success Criteria Met**

- ✅ Package builds without errors
- ✅ Stellar adapter can be imported and instantiated
- ✅ Address derivation works with NEAR accounts
- ✅ Balance checking works with Stellar API
- ✅ Transaction preparation and signing functional
- ✅ NPM package structure is correct
- ✅ All dependencies properly included
- ✅ Package published and accessible
- ✅ Installation and basic usage verified

**Your Stellar integration is fully functional and ready for production use!** 🚀

## 📞 **Next Steps**

1. **Integrate into your main project**
2. **Test with your existing NEAR accounts**
3. **Deploy Stellar functionality to your users**
4. **Monitor and iterate based on usage**

**Congratulations! You now have a fully functional Stellar integration for your Chain Signatures project!** 🎊
